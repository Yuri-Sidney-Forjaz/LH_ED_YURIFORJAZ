Throughout the development phase of a data engineering assignment titled "Data Pipeline Exploration," I navigated various obstacles and achieved several key milestones. The core objective was to develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline capable of sourcing data from both a PostgreSQL database and a CSV file, subsequently storing it on a local drive, and ultimately transferring it to a PostgreSQL database. For this task, Airflow was selected for orchestration, Embulk for data migration, and PostgreSQL for database management. This document outlines my journey, the challenges encountered, and the strategies employed to overcome them.

Initial Environment Setup

My initial steps involved installing Docker and Docker Compose on my Windows machine, ensuring that Airflow, PostgreSQL, and Embulk were properly integrated within the docker-compose.yml configuration. Leveraging my previous experience with Docker, this process was executed smoothly.

Incorporating Airflow

One of the preliminary actions was to incorporate Airflow into the workflow. Upon configuring the Docker containers, I accessed Airflow through localhost:8080 and established the necessary PostgreSQL connections. This phase was executed without issues, thanks to the intuitive setup process, particularly when establishing the postgres_northwind connection.

Obstacle 1: Embulk Activation

The activation of Embulk within the Docker setup presented a significant challenge. Despite being correctly configured in the docker-compose.yml, Embulk failed to activate. This was a crucial setback since Embulk plays a vital role in the data extraction and transformation process. After numerous attempts and consulting Embulk's official documentation, it became apparent that resolving this within the given setup might be unfeasible. Attempts to substitute Embulk with Meltano faced similar activation issues.

Resolution to Obstacle 1

Confronted with continuous issues with Embulk and then Meltano, I decided to reevaluate my approach. I sought solutions by engaging with online communities and scrutinizing Docker's official guides. I suspected the problem could be linked to Docker's network and volume configurations on Windows. Despite exploring various settings, resolving the issue within the project's timeframe proved to be challenging due to time constraints.

Strategic Shift and Advancement

Acknowledging the project's primary goal to demonstrate proficiency in data engineering tasks, I shifted focus towards achievable objectives. I enhanced my understanding of Airflow by creating DAGs capable of theoretically executing the intended tasks, with a focus on idempotency and comprehensive documentation.

Insights Gained and Final Thoughts

The project highlighted the critical role of adaptability and problem-solving within data engineering. Although not all goals were attained, particularly due to technical difficulties with Embulk in a Docker setup, the project offered valuable lessons in managing workflow orchestration via Airflow, Docker container operations, and establishing a resilient ETL pipeline. This experience has equipped me to address similar challenges more effectively in the future, with a better strategic and problem-solving mindset.

In summary, the "Data Pipeline Exploration" assignment was a profound learning experience, emphasizing the need for flexibility in selecting technologies, the significance of thorough documentation, and the development of problem-solving competencies in data engineering. With these insights, I am better prepared to tackle comparable challenges and make meaningful contributions to future data engineering initiatives.
